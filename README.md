# Alpha-Guard 🛡️

**Forensic Credit Risk Platform**

Alpha-Guard is an institutional-grade financial forensics platform that combines traditional financial modeling (Altman Z-Score, Monte Carlo simulations) with advanced AI linguistic stress analysis to detect deception and assess credit risk in publicly traded companies.

Built by [Tanishq Kalra](https://tanishq-kalra.github.io/portfoliotanishq/) as a demonstration of full-stack engineering, financial modeling, and AI integration capabilities.

## 🎯 The Mission

To build a professional-grade forensic credit risk platform that reads between the lines of financial reports. Alpha-Guard doesn't just crunch numbers—it analyzes the semantic sentiment of management discussions to uncover hidden red flags and "Truth Scores."

1. **Data Ingestion**: The system pulls live XBRL financial facts and 10-K text filings from the SEC EDGAR database.
2. **Financial Engine**: Calculates the Altman Z-Score and runs a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) Monte Carlo simulation to stress-test future revenue.
3. **Forensic AI Layer**: Passes the "Management's Discussion" (MD&A) and "Risk Factors" sections to Google's Gemini AI to analyze linguistic hedging, evasion, and sentiment gaps.
4. **Synthesis**: Correlates the hard math (Z-Score) with the soft language (Truth Score) to raise deception alerts.
5. **Reporting**: Generates a branded executive PDF report.
